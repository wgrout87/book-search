## Description

Book Search provides a search function for books and the ability to save books while logged in. This repository contains an updated version of Book Search that has been refactored to use a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server, in the place of the RESTful API that was in place previously.

The original code can be found in the following repository:

## Usage

Any user visiting the site can search for books, but additional functionality is provided to those who wish to save books to their account. While logged in, a button will display for any search results to "Save this Book!". Clicking this button will save the book to the user's account, and from there on, the button will display a message if the user has already saved a book that come up in their search results. The user can also view a list of all the books they have saved by clicking the "See Your Books" option in the nav bar. While viewing saved books, the user will also be presented with the option to delete any books from their list.
